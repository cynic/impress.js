impresst.js
============

This is a fork of [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js), the excellent presentation framework created by Bartek Szopka.  This fork has a few small changes that might be particularly useful for teachers, and some other changes because, well, why not?  If you don't know how to use impress.js, then learn how to do so by taking a look at the original repo, and then come back here :).
